# A systemic lupus erythematosus whole blood compendium

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs. 
Unlike some other conditions that fall under the rheumatic/autoimmune disease umbrella, SLE is not a rare disease and there are multiple gene expression studies (and/or cohorts) of SLE that are publicly available.

Herein, we choose to study SLE whole blood (WB) samples because methods around analyzing these data, including [modular transcriptional analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118927/), are mature. 
This tissue—a mixture of adaptive and innate immune cells—is also highly relevant to this condition and allows us to explore whether or not we can capture or retain cell type-specific expression patterns in our processed data.

In this repository, we compare several normalization and processing methods for the purpose of integrating 7 microarray datasets into a "harmonized" compendium for further analyses. 

### Pipeline

To follow our SLE WB pipeline, run the numbered R scripts in this directory (`sle-wb`) from the top directory of this repository sequentially. 
For example, the first step of our pipeline can be run from the top directory with the following command:

```shell
Rscript sle-wb/1-process_affy_data.R
```

More information about each step in the pipeline is supplied at the top of each script.

## Datasets

We include the following datasets (retrieved from [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)):

These selected data sets are somewhat representative of the large body of publicly available in a few ways: 1) the majority of assays are run on Affymetrix arrays (for which raw data are typically available) and 2) some accessions only have submitter-processed data available on ArrayExpress (like E-GEOD-78193).

## Correlation between normalization methods

First, we compare methods for normalizing Affymetrix arrays: [Robust Multiarray Average (`RMA`)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.249), [Single Channel Array Normalization (`SCAN`)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3508193/) and its "fast" counterpart (`SCANfast`), and find that they are generally well correlated. 
(See [`sle-wb/plots/norm_method_correlation`](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/tree/master/sle-wb/plots/norm_method_correlation) for the full output of this analysis.)

![](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/raw/master/sle-wb/plots/norm_method_correlation/SLE-WB_affy_norm_correlation_hgu133plus2_RMA_v_SCAN.png)

We're interested in normalizing single samples (`SCAN`/`SCANfast`), rather than batches of multiple samples (`RMA`), because that removes any influence of the other samples processed jointly on the single sample's output. 
This is particularly attractive when thinking about assembling [a large, consistently updated compendium](http://www.ccdatalab.org/blog/data-refinery-one/) of gene expression samples. 
As noted in the [`SCAN.UPC` documentation](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SCAN.UPC/inst/doc/SCAN.vignette.pdf#section.5), the output values from `SCAN` and `SCANfast` are highly correlated.

## Platform and/or batch effect

### Within platform

First, we'll look only at datasets from the Affymetrix hgu133plus2 platform (E-GEOD-39088, E-GEOD-61635, E-GEOD-72747). 
It's worth noting here that E-GEOD-39088 and E-GEOD-72747 are both studies of IFN-alpha kinoid (IFN-K), a therapeutic vaccine. 

If we look just at normalization (no scaling), there is [clear separation between the datasets in PC1 and PC3 when normalized with `RMA`](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/plots/PCA/HGU133PLUS2_RMA_PC1-5_pairs_no.transform.png) ([cum. var. exp. (PC1-3) = 0.818](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/plots/PCA/HGU133PLUS2_RMA_PC1-5_pairs_no.transform.tsv)).* 
When `SCANfast` is used as the normalization method, this [dataset-specific effect is less evident after PC1](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/plots/PCA/HGU133PLUS2_SCANfast_PC1-5_pairs_no.transform.png) ([var. exp. (PC1) = 0.563](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/plots/PCA/HGU133PLUS2_SCANfast_PC1-5_pairs_no.transform.tsv)) and the two IFN-K datasets group together.

As demonstrated below, [0, 1] scaling before combining experiments reduces this dataset-specific effect regardless of the normalization method used.

| principal component | cumulative variance explained |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| PC1                 | 0.238                         |

| PC5                 | 0.516                         |

#### SCANfast, [0,1] scaling before concatenation

| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| PC1                 | 0.219                         |
| PC2                 | 0.382                         |
| PC3                 | 0.446                         |
| PC4                 | 0.499                         |
| PC5                 | 0.526                         |

Because of its single-sample processing capability and compute time considerations, we chose to use `SCANfast` as our Affymetrix normalization method.

 _*Note that each experiment was normalized separately; the results may change if RMA was applied across samples from all three datasets at once._

### Between platforms

Once all Affymetrix data is normalized with `SCANfast`, we still must address the submitter-processed data from the Agilent and Illumina platforms.
Here, we've chosen to quantile normalize Agilent and Illumina data using the quantiles from the aggregated Affymetrix data.
(See [`7-quantile_normalize_microarray`](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/7-quantile_normalize_microarray.R) and [`5-aggregate_all_affy_data.R`](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/5-aggregate_all_affy_data.R) for the quantile normalization and Affymetrix aggregation, respectively.) 
Quantile normalization (QN) followed by scaling reduces the dataset/platform-specific effect, as shown below.

#### Without QN, no scaling

| PC5                 | 0.974                         |

| PC5                 | 0.769                       |

(Note: [QN alone groups datasets by platform](https://github.com/greenelab/rheum-plier-data/blob/master/sle-wb/plots/PCA/SLE_WB_all_microarray_QN_PC1-5_no.transform.png), as is expected.)
